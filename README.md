# OpenPolicing_SanDiego

## Project Overview
The data was obtained from The Stanford Open Policing Project ().  
The datatset is cleaned data (by SOPP), with each row representing a police stop.  
Data ranges from 2014-01-01 to 2017-03-31.  
There are a total of 382,844 entries.  

The fields in this dataset are as follows:  
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Column name</td>
    <td>Column meaning</td>
    <td>Example value</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>raw_row_number</td>

    <td>38299</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>date</td>
    <td>The date of the stop, in YYYY-MM-DD format. Some states do not provide
    the exact stop date: for example, they only provide the year or quarter in
    which the stop occurred. For these states, stop_date is set to the date at
    the beginning of the period: for example, January 1 if only year is
    provided.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>time</td>
    <td>The 24-hour time of the stop, in HH:MM format.</td>
    <td>20:15</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>service_area</td>
    <td>Police service area. If not provided, but we have retrieved police
    department shapefiles and the location of the stop, we geocode the stop and
    find the service area using the shapefiles.</td>
    <td>8</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>subject_age</td>
    <td>The age of the stopped subject. When date of birth is given, we
    calculate the age based on the stop date. Values outside the range of
    10-110 are coerced to NA.</td>
